# RRSP vs TFSA calculator

This calculator compares using a TFSA (tax-free savings account) and RRSP (registered retirement savings plan) to save money.

RRSPs allow Canadians to defer paying taxes until they withdraw money from their account. In practice Canadians get a tax refund on the money they deposited into RSP. A TFSA, on the other hand, allows Canadians to save their after tax money in a way that the future growth (interest earned) remains tax-free forever so all future withdrawals are not taxed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
